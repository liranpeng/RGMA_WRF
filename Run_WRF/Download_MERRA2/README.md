   The Download_MERRA.py script reads `missing_data.txt` to identify all files or dates that require downloading.

2. **Download Process**

   `Download_MERRA.py` connects to the data server, authenticates if needed, and downloads each specified file.

3. **Variables**

   The MERRA2 files downloaded include key atmospheric and aerosol variables. A summary of variable names and conventions can be found in `MERRA.name`.
